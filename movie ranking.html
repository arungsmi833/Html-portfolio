<P>The story of ambitious Rocky‚Äôs partial journey towards power and riches. The story is told in a non linear format which travels to and fro between 1951 to 2018.   The film wastes no time and picks up steam from the word go. The first half episodes build the character of Rocky and establishes him has a powerful maverick don</P>

<p>One movie, a lot of housefull shows in the theater, full of noises, cheers and applauses, a scenario that celebrates a kannada movie all over Kerala. Today after the morning 11am house full show, I got the best theater experience of my life. A view that celebrates a movie by the whole generation without the language barriers.
    KGF : Today, it is a brand. A brand that no one in Indian cinema history can break.üôåüèª</p>
